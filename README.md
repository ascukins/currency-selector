# Currency Selector

Angular component for multiple choice selection from array.

Mostly, CSS playground.

Features:

- Basic Angular component interaction
- Various uses of position: relative and position: absolute, including centering
- Checkbox custom styling

Tested to work identically on Chrome for Windows, Firefox for Windows, and Safari for iOS.

Does not look particularly fashionable, that's by design.)
